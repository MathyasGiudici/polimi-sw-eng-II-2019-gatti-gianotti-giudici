# Software Engineering 2 A.Y. 2018-2019

The objective of this project was to apply in practice what we have learnt during lectures with the purpose of becoming familiar with software engineering practices and able to address new software engineering issues in a rigorous way.
The project includes two assignments:
1. The preparation of a Requirement Analysis and Specification Document (RASD);
2. The definition of the Design Document (DD).

## Documents
1. [RASD](https://github.com/MathyasGiudici/GattiGianottiGiudici/blob/master/RASD/rasd.pdf);
2. [DD](https://github.com/MathyasGiudici/GattiGianottiGiudici/tree/master/DD).
