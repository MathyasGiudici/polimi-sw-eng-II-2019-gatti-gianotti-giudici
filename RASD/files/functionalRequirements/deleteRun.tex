\myparagraph{Purpose}
As we have the possibilty in \textit{Track4Run} for an organizer to be able to create a new \textit{Run}. The system must be able to manage the decision of an organizer to delete a \textit{Run}.

\myparagraph{Scenario}
Alice want to delete a \textit{Run} that she had organized for the next month, because the weather forecast are not the optimal.
In order to avoid a rainy day Alice opened \textit{Track4Run} web-site, she logged in and she clicked on \textit{Manage a Run}.
On top of the table there was the \textit{Run} that she was looking for, she clicked on it and when the \textit{Run} was opened she clicked on \textit{Delete}.
After that a mail arrived in Alice mailbox, it was the confirmation of the elimination of the \textit{Run}.

\myparagraph{Use Case}
The \textit{Delete a Run} use case is analyzed in Table \ref{table:deleteRunTable}.

\myparagraph{Functional requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
