\myparagraph{Purpose}
Everytime a special user wants to access to the data of a specific individual it has to pass through some steps:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item It has to insert the SSN of the targeted individual, who will receive a direct request that he/she can accept or refuse;
  \item If the request has been accepted the special user will receive an e-mail with the amount it has to pay to download the required data;
  \item If it pays the amount due it can download the required data.
\end{enumerate}

\myparagraph{Scenario 1}
AC Milan wants to acquire information about the lifestyle of Cristino Ronaldo, so it opens the browser and searches for \textit{Data4Help} web site, it logs in and then it goes in "\textit{Data Search}" area. Then it inserts Ronaldo's SSN, clicks on "\textit{Submit}" button and waits a couple of days for a response. Unfortunately, Ronaldo doesn't accept the request, AC Milan receives an e-mail containing the negative response and the process ends.

\myparagraph{Scenario 2}
The "San Gerardo" hospital of Monza is trying \textit{Data4Help} combined with \textit{AutomatedSOS} to monitor the health status of some of its patients after the dismissal. Lucia has been dismissed a couple of month ago and she has \textit{AutomatedSOS} installed on her smartphone. The "San Gerardo" hospital accesses to \textit{Data4Help} from the web site, logs in, goes in "\textit{Data Search}" area, inserts Lucia's SSN, clicks on the "\textit{Submit}" button and waits a couple of days for a response. Lucia accepts the request, so the "San Gerardo" hospital receives an e-mail with the amount  it has to pay, pays it and downloads Lucia's data.

\myparagraph{Use Case}
The \textit{Individual Data Requirement} use case is analyzed in Table \ref{table:individualDataRequirement}.

\myparagraph{Activity Diagram}
The \textit{Individual Data Requirement} activity diagram is shown in Figure \ref{img:individualDataRequirementActivityDiagram}.

\myparagraph{Mockup}
The \textit{Individual Data Requirement} mocukp is shown in Figure \ref{img:individualDataRequirementMockup}.

\myparagraph{Functional requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The system must refuse a non existant SSN;
  \item The system must not let the special user download the required data untill it hasn't paid the amount due;
  \item The system must send an e-mail in case of negative response and end the process;
  \item The system must send an e-mail with the amount due in case of positive response;
  \item The system must let the \textbf{Special user} leave the data requirement process at anytime.
\end{enumerate}
