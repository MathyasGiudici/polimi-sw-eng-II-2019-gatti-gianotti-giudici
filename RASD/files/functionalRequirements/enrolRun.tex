\myparagraph{Purpose}
One of the great feature of \textit{Track4Run} is the possibility for a runner to be able to enrol in a \textit{Run}.
In order to enrol in a \textit{Run} a runner must be logged in \textit{Track4Run} application, he/she has to search the \textit{Run} that he/she wants in the \textit{Enrol in a Run} section and finally enrols in it.
However, the \textit{Run} could be already done or the enrolling time expired.

\myparagraph{Scenario 1}
Andrea is a technological boy. A few weeks ago he found in the Play Store the new app \textit{Track4Run} and shared his discovery with his friends. Yesterday, while he was hanging out with the buddies they discovered a new run for the week-end after.
So, Andrea took his phone, opened \textit{Track4Run} app, logged in, clicked on the "\textit{Enrol in a Run}" button and found it on the top of the page. So Andrea clicked on it and when the \textit{Run} event was opened he cliked on the "\textit{Enrol}" button.
After that Andrea received a confirmation e-mail about the correctness of the enrolment.

\myparagraph{Scenario 2}
Samanta loves walking but for a few months now she started running. She spoke about the city \textit{Run} planned in two days with her friend Federica, but unfortunately when she took her phone and opened \textit{Track4Run} she discovered that the time to enrol in the \textit{Run} was expired yet.
