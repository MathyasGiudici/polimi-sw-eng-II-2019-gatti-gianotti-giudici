\myparagraph{Scenario 1}
Chiara has just finished her studies and has just found a new job, so she wants to update the occupation field on her profile. She opens \textit{Data4Help} web site from her personal computer, she logs in and goes in her "\textit{Edit profile}" area. The system gives her the possibility to change either her city of residence or her occupation, she changes her occupation from student to emplyed and she clicks on the "\textit{Submit changes}" button.

\myparagraph{Scenario 2}
Matteo has just finished the registration process, but he doesn't like the password he was given by the system and he wants to change it. He opens \textit{AutomatedSOS} application on his smartphone, logs in and accesses to his "\textit{Edit profile}" area. Now he clicks on the "\textit{Change password}" button and inserts the old password and the new password twice as required by the system. Finally he clicks on the "\textit{Submit changes}" button.

\myparagraph{Scenario 3}
Aldo moved to USA and so he decides to delete his profile on \textit{Track4Run} because he was used to use it to organize amateur runs with his friends, but now he won't be able to do it anymore. He opens \textit{Track4Run} application on his smartphone, logs in and accesses to his "\textit{Edit profile}" area. Now he clicks on the "\textit{Delete profile}" button and confirms his choice. The system removes all Aldo's information from the database.

\myparagraph{Scenario 4}
Franco has just received a new smartwatch for his birthday and so he wants to change the device associated to his \textit{Data4Help} profile. He opens \textit{Track4Run} application on his smartphone, logs in and accesses to his "\textit{Edit profile}" area. Then he clicks on "\textit{Change device}" button and turns on the bluetooth of the new smartwatch and of his smartphone. He inerts correctly on his smartphone the six digits number that appears on the new smartwatch and clicks on "\textit{Done}" button. Now he can use his new smartwatch;
