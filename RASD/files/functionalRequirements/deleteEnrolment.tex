\myparagraph{Purpose}
As we have the possibilty in \textit{Track4Run} for a runner to be able to enrol in a \textit{Run}, the system must also be able to manage the decision of a runner to delete his/her enrolment.

\myparagraph{Scenario}
Giulia is enrolled in the annual \textit{Run} of her neighborhood. The enrolment management was made through \textit{Track4Run} application. Unfortunately for the day of the \textit{Run} Giulia will be in Florence for an important work meeting.
When Giulia received the meeting mail she took her phone, she opened \textit{Track4Run} app and she clicked on "\textit{Enrolled Run}" button.
The only row in the table was the annual \textit{Run}, Giulia clicked on it and then clicked on "\textit{Delete Enrolment}" button.
After that Giulia received a confirmation e-mail.

\myparagraph{Functional requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The system must not show \textit{Run}, in \textit{Enrolled Run} section, in which a \textbf{Runner} is not enrolled;
  \item The system must let the \textbf{Runner} delete his/her enrolment in a \textit{Run} at anytime;
  \item The system must let the \textbf{Runner} leave the elimination process at anytime.
\end{enumerate}
