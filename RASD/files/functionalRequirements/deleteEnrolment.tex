\myparagraph{Purpose}
As we have the possibilty in \textit{Track4Run} for a runner to be able to enrol a \textit{Run}. The system must be able to manage the decision of a runner to delete his/her enrolment.

\myparagraph{Scenario}
Giulia is enrolled for the annual \textit{Run} of her neighborhood. The enrolment management was made through \textit{Track4Run} application. Unfortunately for the day of the \textit{Run} Giulia will be in Florence for an important work meeting.
When Giulia received the meeting mail she took her phone, she opened \textit{Track4Run} app and she clicked on \textit{Enrolled Run}.
The only row in the table was the annual \textit{Run}, Giulia clicked on it and the she clicked on \textit{Delete Enrolment} button.
After that Giulia received a confirmation e-mail.
